# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project

To facilitate the 3D model designers/Makers  to  mint abd  sell their  3D design models as nfts without the need for a centralized agency. 3D design files are then used by owners  to print to give physical shape to designs using 3D Printers

# Project Workflow

##
 1. Smart contract (variant of ERC721) will be deployed on Ehereum Network (Main/Testnet) that will allow desiners to mint tokens and cleints to buy them.
 2. Designers will be authenticated using Metamask to register their design files and mint tokens with base price.
 3. Clients will be able to see minted NFTs (Design Files) and can become owners by coleecting/buying them.
 4. On every sell order of particular design NFT, original Designer gets some percentage of sell price.
