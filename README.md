# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project
## REAL ESTATE TOKENIZATION DAPP
Recording and Tracking of Asset ownership  including Land, Housing and Real Estate has been challenging and cubersome task since the distant past. As part of this project we design and develop non fungible real esate token DApp to represent various aspects and happenenings in the city pertaing to Real Estate (Land, Building rtc.) 

# Project Workflow


 1. Smart contract (variant of ERC721) will be deployed on Ehereum Network (Main/Testnet) that will allow desiners to mint tokens and cleints to buy them.
 2. Designers will be authenticated using Metamask to register their design files and mint tokens with base price.
 3. Clients will also be authenticated  to be able to see minted NFTs (Design Files) and optionally can become owners by collecting/buying them.
 4. On every sell order of particular design NFT, original Designer gets some percentage of sell price.
