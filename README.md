# REAL ESTATE TOKENIZATION DAPP
## Problem Definition
Recording and Tracking of Asset ownership  including Land, Housing and Real Estate has been challenging and cumbersome task since the distant past. As part of this project we design and develop non fungible real esate token DApp to represent various aspects and happenenings in the city pertainingg to Real Estate (Land, Building rtc.) with some sought of Regulation to comply local laws.

## Project Workflow

 1. City Mayor will deploy Smart contract (variant of ERC721)  on Ehereum Network (Main/Testnet) .
 2. City Mayor will  mint tokens in order to regiter assets to the real  Owners.
 3. Owners have the option to put thier assets for sale by setting price and approving buyers to be able to buy specific assets.
 3. Approved Buyers will only be able to buy assets which then can sell to other buyers by first approving them.   
 3. We also incorporated an assessment phase that allows city Mayor to appreciate or deppreciate the asset by either increasing or decreasing the asset price.
 4. As part of the future work, we also plan to include  auction mechanism and other governance realted stuff.
